## Project Overview
This data science project aims to predict the quality of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset consists of physicochemical (input) and sensory (output) variables, with no information about grape types, wine brand, or selling price due to privacy and logistic constraints.

### Summary and Conclusion

In this project, I focused on predicting wine quality using various data preprocessing techniques and a machine learning model. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Target Column Simplification: The target column, quality, was simplified from multiple categories to two categories to reduce complexity and improve model performance.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Appropriate visualizations were created to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into the dataset.

3. Data Standardization:
   - Data standardization was performed to normalize the features, ensuring consistency across the dataset.

4. Model Training and Optimization:
   - The performance of the Random Forest model was optimized using Grid Search.
   - This optimization process led to a significant improvement in model accuracy, achieving a final accuracy of 91.2%.

These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a highly accurate prediction model for wine quality.
